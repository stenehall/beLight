# README

A very simple web based tellstick net app. Currently only supports on/off states.

This is really not meant to be used yet

## Installation

Currently runs on heroku using a single web worker, i.e. for free.
To make it run you will first need to create an github and/or facebook app for authentication and set the variables found in config/production.js using `heroku config:set`

## Todo
* Finish all tests
* Add support for dimmer
* Only show active auth methods
* Add more auth methods
